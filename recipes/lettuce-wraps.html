    <h1>Lettuce Wraps</h1>
    <img src="lettuce.png" alt="lettuce wraps">
    <p>Delicious and bursting with flavor, Asian lettuce wraps are a great idea for entertaining or a family style meal. 
        Each person can build their own fresh, delicious wrap. Just be sure to have plates or napkins available since 
        the mixture can sometimes drip a little. To serve, allow each person to spoon a portion of the meat into a 
        lettuce leaf. Wrap the lettuce around the meat like a burrito and enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>16 lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not tear them. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and cooking oil in
             the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease;
              transfer beef to a bowl. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet used for beef until
               slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar,
                ginger, and chile pepper sauce into onions. Add water chestnuts, green onions,
                 sesame oil, and cooked beef; cook and stir until the onions just begin to wilt,
                  about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter and pile meat mixture in the center.</li>
    </ol>
