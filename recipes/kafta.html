    <p>The yummiest preparation mixture for ground beef EVER!
         I have made this Lebanese Meat for all of my friends and
          family and have HAD to leave the recipe with everyone! 
          Meat mixture can be used for everything... meatballs, 
          meatloaf, BBQ skewers, BBQ'd hamburgers. FOR BEST,
           AUTHENTIC LEBANESE TASTE, DO NOT OMIT OR SUBSTITUTE
            INGREDIENTS (until you have made it this way</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 grated onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp allspice</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>6 skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. If using wooden skewers, soak in water.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, parsley, cayenne, allspice,
             salt and pepper until evenly blended. Divide into 6 portions, and press
              around one end of the skewers to form a log shape approximately 1 inch thick and 6 inches long.</li>
        <li>Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until meat is no longer pink.</li>
    </ol>
